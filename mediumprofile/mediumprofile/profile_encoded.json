From a professional context, I have several years of experience with hyperspectral data and low-latency classification and regression problems. I have a deep interest in the mathematical/statistical background of machine learning algorithms. I am mostly focussed on creating solutions that take into account the characteristics of the available data, therefore this process often results in custom-made algorithms or pre-processing steps. In my spare time I love to dive into the domain of time series, more specifically algorithmic trading.", "followers": "8 Followers"},
